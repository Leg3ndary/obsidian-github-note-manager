# Obsidian-Note-Manager

This is a personal project that I started to help me with school and managing notes online

This will only link your notes to a github repository, private or public, you can then commit and the plugin will automatically pull and fetch any new updates you may make from another computer, this also allows you to view everything on github.

Enjoy.
